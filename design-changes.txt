DESIGN CHANGES

originally intended for attack_speed to be an attribute of weapons and monsters
    higher attack speed attacks first, with the faster one maybe taking multiple attacks if the difference was great enough 
    this was changed due to how we ended up making the combat system, as the target does not hit back after the player attacks them

enchant being a flat bonus
    our original intent was for the enchant value to just be like a flat bonus to the attack value, rather than a multiplier
    this was changed to be a multiplier because the flat value was also tied to the original attack_speed idea, and without that the multiplier seemed more fitting

room events
    certain rooms would be rest areas, or have a shop
    in part due to time constraints, these were cut. The shop in particular was something we wanted but ended up not developing

equipment
    items that had effects outside of stat buffs/healing (e.g. grappling hook that moves your character directly to a wall)
    this would be really hard to program in a smart, efficient manner while also not necessarily adding enough to be considered "worth it"

party/controlling multiple characters
    creating a more tactical game where the player controls multiple units would have been really fun and cool
    we ended up cutting this to ensure that the project would fit in time constraints after we figured how this would add unnecessary difficulty to programming the game


FUTURE PLANS

store
    although we cut it due to time, if we were to continue working, the shop would be a high priority for adding next

branching paths
    allowing the player to choose from a variety of rooms based on what rewards the player wants adds more agency to the player in ensuring they have a run that suits them and prevents them from getting bottlenecked on a particular resource (i.e. not getting any new weapons and using the starter rusty weapon an entire run)

more consumables
    simply adding more consumables to the database would allow for a more fun, varied experience and make inventory management more necessary

more floors
    allowing the game to go longer or have more variety in the existing floors creates more encounters and increases replayability

balancing
    currently, the game is very unbalanced: monsters deal too much damage or have too much hp, which makes progressing in the game difficult

adding more character classes/differentiating the characters more
    having more unlockables would increase replayability
    it could be possible to add a sort of "spell list" or other special moves using inheritance to create more variety in how the player engages with each class and create more playstyles

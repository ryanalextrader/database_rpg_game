## Jerry's Quest

You play as __Jerry__, a man who has been estranged in time within a mysterious forest. You have died several times already, and each time you wake up back in the same clearing. All you have found out so far is that the further you get from this one glen, the more violent and aggressive the creatures become. If you make it far enough, you might just find a way out...

## How to play

__W A S D__ to select a tile <br/>
__[SPACE]__ to act (move / attack) <br/>
__E__ to skip your action <br/>
__Q__ to open your inventory <br/>
__[ESC]__ to quit<br/>
<br/>
Your damage on any attack is calculated as: str + atk<br/>
The atk value is your average atk value, and certain weapons have greater ranges than others<br/>
Additionally, as the distance of your attack increases, your accuracy will decrease<br/>
<br/>
Your character is represented as '<span style="color:blue">@</span>'<br/>
Tiles highlighted in <span style="color:green">green</span> are those within the player's movement range<br/>
Monsters, marked in <span style="color:red">red</span>, will have an exclamation point after them if they are within the player's attack range<br/>
A monster will instead be <span style="color:magenta">magenta</span> if it has just acted<br/>
<br/>
Every 5 floors, there will be a boss encounter. Defeating a boss will unlock a new starting class<br/>
There is currently a total of 20 floors
